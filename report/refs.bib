  abstract      = {We deployed pop-up archival transmitting tags on 15 loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) that had been lightly hooked in the United States pelagic longline fishery and on 10 loggerheads that we dip-netted off the surface to serve as controls in the North Atlantic Ocean. We received data from tags of 10 lightly hooked turtles and 7 control turtles. We used data transmitted by the tags in a known-fate model to estimate annual survival rates and determine if there were differences in survival between the 2 groups. The best model indicates there is no difference in survival between the lightly hooked and control turtles, and the estimated annual survival rate was 0.814 (95\% {CI} = 0.557–0.939). Our results suggest that when all fishing gear is removed lightly hooked turtles may not suffer any additional mortality relative to control turtles.},

  abstract      = {* There are few reliable estimates of post-release mortality for sea turtle species because of the many challenges and costs associated with tracking animals released at sea. In this study, the likelihood of sea turtle mortality as a result of interactions with longline fishing gear was estimated based on satellite telemetry data, such as the number of days an animal was successfully tracked, or days at liberty ({DAL}) and dive depth data, as well as anatomical hooking locations.

* Pop-up satellite archival tags were deployed on 29 loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) caught by the North Pacific {US}-based pelagic longline fishery operating from California and Hawaii between 2002 and 2006. Loggerhead turtles were catagorized by observers as shallow-hooked (55\%) if the animal was entangled in the line or the hook was in the flipper, jaw or mouth and could be removed, or deep-hooked (45\%) if the hook was ingested and could not be removed. The vertical movements of turtles were used to infer potential mortalities.

* Of the 25 tags that reported data, the {DAL} ranged from 3 to 243 days (mean = 68 days). The {DAL} was shorter (by nearly 50\%) for shallow-hooked (mean = 48 days, range: 3 to 127) compared to deep-hooked turtles (mean = 94 days, range: 5 to 243), but these changes were not statistically significant (P = 0.0658).

* Although aspects of these analyses may be considered speculative, these data provide empirical evidence to indicate that deep-hooking is not linked to shorter {DAL}.

* {DAL}, anatomical hooking location, and gear removal were evaluated with inferences about the extent of injuries and rates of infection to estimate an overall post-release mortality rate of 28\% (95\% bootstrap {CI}: 16–52\%).

* This range of estimates is consistent with those used to shape some {US} fisheries management plans, suggesting that conservation goals are being achieved at the expected level and ideally striking a balance between the interests of industry and those of protected species.
