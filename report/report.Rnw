\section{Methods}
Over the course of 4 tagging seasons, 80 pop-up satellite archival tags were deployed by researchers, commercial fishermen and fishery observers.  Combined these tracking data cover 9785 turtle-days.

Tag data was [[MIKE: DOWNLOADED FROM WC WEBSITE]] and processed using WC-DAP v3.0.369. Status messages and the minimum and maximum depths reported by WC-DAP were used to infer turtle fate. The tags were programmed to release after a set period, after [[MIKE: X days]] constant depth or reaching a maximum depth threshold to allow transmission of data prior to tag failure.

\section{Results}
Tag fate per year:

<<echo=FALSE,results=tex>>=
print(xtable(table(info$fate,year(info$deployDate))))
@

Tag types per year:
<<echo=FALSE,results=tex>>=
print(xtable(table(info$Tag.Type,year(info$deployDate))))
@

Observer/hook type:

<<echo=FALSE,results=tex>>=
print(xtable(table(ifelse(is.na(info$observer),'Unknown',info$observer),info$hook)))
